Exam project
Project for my course's final exam. Made in two parts - administrator panel and user panel. The users with administrator role can upload books, categories, authors and
publishers, which afterwards are displayed in the user part of the web site. Administrators can also see all of the users' details and completed orders (as well as the 
guests' orders).
